    For each token in the sequence, a list of values from the discrete

    Tokens will be included here if and only if they are in the top K=15
    tokens predicted by the simulator, and excluded otherwise.

    May be transformed to another unit by calibration. When we simulate a neuron,
    we produce a discrete distribution with values in the arbitrary discretized space
    of the neuron, e.g. 10% chance of 0, 70% chance of 1, 20% chance of 2.
    Which we store as distribution_values = [0, 1, 2],
    distribution_probabilities = [0.1, 0.7, 0.2]. When we transform the distribution to
    the real activation units, we can correspondingly transform the values of this
    distribution to get a distribution in the units of the neuron. e.g. if the mapping
    from the discretized space to the real activation unit of the neuron is f(x) = x/2,
    then the distribution becomes 10% chance of 0, 70% chance of 0.5, 20% chance of 1.
